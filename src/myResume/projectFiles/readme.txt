The project files are used with the 'project' component as part of the myresume 
package. It utilises the 'CodeWindow', 'contentCarosel' componenent, hence each projectFile include
the 1) 'fileList' (used for codeWindow - popup), 2) 'items' (used for contentCarousel) objects which 
is utilised within the scope of 'project' to reduce complexity. Hence, by updating the projectFile, 
the myresume project will be automatically updated.
